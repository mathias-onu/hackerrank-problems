# HackerRank problems and DS & Algorithms practice

JavaScript/TypeScript solutions to various HackerRank (and other sources) problems related to data structures and algorithms.

I'm using this repo to also commit practice-related code while deepening my data structures and algorithms skills.

After installing the packages (```npm install```), in order to run a ts file run: 
```bash
npm run script -- path-to-ts-file
```
